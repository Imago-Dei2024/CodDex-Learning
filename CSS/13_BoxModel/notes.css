/* --- 13. Box Model --- */ 
/* The box model describes how an element handles its content 
    and the space around it. */ 
/* Every element is made of 4 box layers: 
    1.) A "content box" for things like text and images 
    2.) A "padding-box" of space around the content 
    3.) A "border-box" that goes around the padding 
    4.) A "margin-box" of empty space that surrounds the whole element
