// In JavaScript, variables are used for storing data values that can be used later in the program. Each variable has a name and they hold a value. ðŸ“¦ // 
// To create or declare a variable, we need a let or const keyword:

// "let" is used for variables where the value will change.
// "const" is used for variables where the value will stay constant. 

//After the keyword, we need a variable name, an = sign, and a value: 
// keyword name = value; // 

// Example: 
// const userID="1618033988"; 
// let userName = "Leeroy Jenkins"; 

// You may have noticed that variable names like userName are written in camelCase, where the first word is all lowercase and the first letter of all other words are capitalized. 
// This convention is used for variable names made of more than one word.

//The = equal sign means assignment. We are:
// Assigning the value "1618033988" to the const variable userId.
// Assigning the value "Leeroy Jenkins" to the let variable userName.


// For a let variable, we can change its value, or print it out:
let userName="Leeroy Jenkins"; 
userName="Leeroy05"; 
console.log(userName);

// For a const variable, we can't change its value, but we can still print it: 
const userId="1618033988"; 
console.log(userId);
