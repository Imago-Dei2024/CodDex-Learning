/* Suppose you got detention and the professor asks you to write a phrase 100 times.

    Let's create a program that uses for loops to make short work of this!

    Use the for loop to log the following message to the Console 100 times: 
    "I Must Not Tell Lies" */ 

for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++ ) { 
    console.log("I Must Not Tell Lies")
}
