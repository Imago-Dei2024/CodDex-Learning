/* The year is 2099... we can now take a vacation on the moon or Mars! ðŸš€



Create a weight conversion program that:

Takes your weight on Earth.
Converts it to your weight on either the moon or Mars.
To calculate your weight on Mars:


destination_weight=earth_weightÃ—0.38

The output of the program should look like this:

Your weight on Earth is 210 pounds.
Your weight on Mars is 79.8 pounds.

let earth_Weight = 188; 

let destination_Weight = (earth_Weight) * 0.38;  

console.log("Your Weight on Earth is: " + earth_Weight + "lbs"); 
console.log("Your Weight on Mars is: " + destination_Weight + "lbs");
