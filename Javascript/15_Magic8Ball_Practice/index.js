/* The Magic 8 Ball is a popular office toy and children's toy invented in the 1940's for fortune-telling and advice seeking. ðŸŽ±

    It's an oversized 8 ball with some of the following answers:

    1.) Yes - definitely.
    2.) It is decidedly so.
    3.) Without a doubt.
    4.) Reply hazy, try again.
    5.) Ask again later.
    6.) Better not tell you now.
    7.) My sources say no.
    8.) Outlook not so good.
    9.) Very doubtful.
    10.) Create a magic8.js program that can respond to any Yes or No questions with a different answer each time it executes.
