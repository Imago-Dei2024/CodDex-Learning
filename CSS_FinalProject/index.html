                <h2>About Me</h2> 
                <p>My name is Connor Laber. A little bit of background for you; I was born and raised in the wonderful rocky mountains in Denver, Colorado. I grew up fishing, 
                    hiking, and mountain biking. I hold two bachelors degrees both in <b>Business Administration</b> and <b>Finance.</b> I am a self taught programmer, with proficency and understanding 
                    in several coding languages including: python, html, css, javascript, and Swift. I first began programming for the sake of helping meet a need for my mothers businesses. 
                    They were in desperate need of a website, and me being a curious learner decided that I wanted to learn programming so that I could build them their own, personalized 
                    website. In the future, I hope to apply my skills and expertise both in FinTech and/or private equity.

                <h2>My Journey this far</h2> 
                <p>With proficency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as a solid understanding of React development, I have worked on various different 
                    front-end web development projects for businesses in need. 
                    Websites are absolutley essential for any and every business, regardless of the size or scope of work. Without it, people simply will not know your business exists.
