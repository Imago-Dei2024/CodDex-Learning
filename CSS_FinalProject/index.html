                <h2>About Me</h2> 
                <p>My name is Connor Laber. A little bit of background for you; I was born and raised in the wonderful rocky mountains in Denver, Colorado. I grew up fishing, 
                    hiking, and mountain biking. I hold two bachelors degrees both in <b>Business Administration</b> and <b>Finance.</b> I am a self taught programmer, with proficency and understanding 
                    in several coding languages including: python, html, css, javascript, and Swift. I first began programming for the sake of helping meet a need for my mothers businesses. 
                    They were in desperate need of a website, and me being a curious learner decided that I wanted to learn programming so that I could build them their own, personalized 
                    website. In the future, I hope to apply my skills and expertise both in FinTech and/or private equity.
