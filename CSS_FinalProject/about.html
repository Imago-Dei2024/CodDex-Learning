                <p> My name is Connor Laber, a Denver, Colorado native shaped by the rugged beauty of the Rocky Mountains, where I grew up fishing, hiking, and mountain biking. 
                    Armed with two bachelors degrees in <b>Business Administration</b> and <b>Finance.</b>, I discovered a deeper calling through coding- a spark ignited when I taught myself 
                    HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, and Swift to build a website to serve the needs of my mothers business, What began as a curious challenge to solve a practical  
                    need became a mission to harness technology for good. I dream of leaving a lasting, <i><u>Christ-centered</u></i> impact on the world, crafting innovative FinTech and private equity  
                    solutions that empower people, simplify lives, and lay the foundation for a brighter future.
