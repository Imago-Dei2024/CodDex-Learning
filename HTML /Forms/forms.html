<!-- To create a form in HTML, we can use the <form> element --> 
  <form action="" method=""> 
    <!-- more code will go here --> 
  </form> 

  <!-- Two attributes are commonly used with the <form> element --> 
  <!-- The "action" attribute says where the form data should go after it is submitted --> 
  <!-- The "method" attribute for how the form data is processed --> 
  <!-- It is usually either send somewhere else via "post" or used with something else via "get" --> 

  <!-- INPUTS --> 
  <!-- In HTML forms, we can use the <input> element as an interactive control for entering data --> 
  <!-- A "type" attribute is used to determine the kind of input to use --> 
  <form> 
    <input type="text"> 
  </form>  

  <form> 
    <input type="submit" 
  </form> 
  
  <!-- By default, the text of the "submit" input type will say "submit" --> 
  <!-- This can be changed by setting a value attribute for the <input> element. -->

    <input type="text">  
  </form> 

  <form>
